This is my first project. It is a weather application and in order to create it, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. This app can show you the current temperature and other current information, such as humidity or wind speed for the city you are looking for, but also the forecast for the next five days. The app also use geolocation to show weather information from your exact location. I was able to obtain all this information with the help of OpenWeather API.
The app is hosted on Netlify and can be reached through the following link: https://warm-melba-0ea802.netlify.app/.
